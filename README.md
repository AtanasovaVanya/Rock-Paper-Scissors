 This is a simple two-player game where you and your opponent (the computer) simultaneously choose one of the following three options: "rock", "paper" or "scissors".  
  
 - Rock beats scissors (the scissors get broken by the rock)
 - Scissors beats paper (the paper gets cut by the scissors)
 - Paper beats rock (the paper covers the rock)
